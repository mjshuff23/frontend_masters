# Functional Programming (in JavaScript)

This is a collection of resources for learning functional programming.  This is derived from Frontend Masters course of the same name.

## What is Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.  A paradigm is a way of thinking about programming, and functional programming is one of many paradigms.  Other types of programming paradigms include object-oriented programming, imperative programming, declarative, and logic programming.

Functional programming boils down to one simple idea, functions should be pure.  A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any observable side effect.

Pure functions - Only input in, only output out
